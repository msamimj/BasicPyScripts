renameQR.py ------------------------------

wrote it to rename qr codes generated in google sheets. the codes were in 10 folders each containing files named QR Code 1 - QR Code 50, so had to rename files in subsequent folders to QR Code 1 - QR Code 50, QR Code 51 - QR Code 100, QR Code 101 - QR Code 150 and so on.

eg: converts QR Code 5 to QR Code 55
